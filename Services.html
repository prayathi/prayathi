                Software as a Service - also known as SaaS, is new business concept that has potential
                to revolutionize the way people have used software traditionally. SaaS refers to
                software that is accessed via a web browser and is paid on a subscription basis
                (monthly or yearly). Different from the traditional model where a customer buys
                a license to software and assumes ownership for its maintenance and installation,
                SaaS presents significant advantages to the customer.</p>
